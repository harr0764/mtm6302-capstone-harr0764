Pokedex

Design Decisions:
Color Palette: I chose a red, white, and blue theme to capture the essence of a Pokeball. It adds a vibrant touch that aligns well with the Pokémon theme.
Typography: For the app name, I selected Press Start 2P for a playful, retro feel. Bungee is used for the navigation links, as it's easier to read, while Roboto ensures clarity for the body text. When clicking on a nav link, it turns blue to indicate the active page. I also opted for a Pokedex symbol for the gallery, which felt fitting.
Layout: The grid layout is user-friendly, adapting smoothly to various screen sizes and allowing for easy scrolling.
User Actions: Users can click on Pokémon cards for more details, mark them as caught using the Pokeball icon, return to the previous page, and use a "More" button to discover additional Pokémon.
Responsive Design: I made sure the design looks good on all devices. Whether on a phone, tablet, or desktop, the layout adjusts to maintain a clean and functional appearance.

All of the assets I used in my mockup were sourced from these links:
Icons for navigation and the "caught" icon, as well as the "More" button on tablet: [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)
Pokémon info, images and sprites: [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page)
