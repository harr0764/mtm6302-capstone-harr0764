# Capstone Project - Part 3 Report

Steps Taken

*Project Structure:*
- Set up an organized file structure with three core HTML files: gallery.html (formerly index.html), caught.html, and details.html.
- Designed a consistent header banner and navigation bar across pages for a unified look and easy navigation.
- Integrated a font style and color scheme to match the theme, with layout adjustments made through media queries.

*Gallery Page (index.html):*

- Each Pokémon is displayed as a card with an number, image and name. Clicking on any card directs the user to the details.html page, where additional information is shown.
- Designed a responsive grid layout for displaying Pokémon cards, which adjusts to screen size for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- A "Load More" button is planned for future implementation using JavaScript to dynamically load more Pokémon when needed.

*Caught Page (caught.html):*

- Includes a “View Details” link for each Pokémon, styled consistently with the rest of the page, allowing users to view more information on the details.html page.
- Designed with a different layout from the gallery.html page for a varied yet cohesive user experience.

*Details Page (details.html):*

- Created a Bulbasaur-focused evolution section featuring Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, and Venusaur sprites. This section includes placeholder images, and each sprite is intended for future interaction using JavaScript.
- Set up a split layout with Bulbasaur’s image and title on the left, and info boxes on the right for Bulbasaur’s characteristics: Description, Type, Abilities, Gender Ratio, and Catch Rate.
- Used media queries for responsive design, rearranging the layout so info boxes move below the image on smaller screens for better readability.
- Added a return button in the top-left corner for quick navigation back to the previous page.

Resources

- PokéAPI: PokéAPI was used as the main data source for all Pokémon-related information.
- Icons8: Icons8 provided high-quality icons used in the navigation and details page sections.
- Google Fonts: Fonts such as Bungee, Press Start 2P, and Roboto were sourced from Google Fonts for consistency in text styling across the project.

Challenges Faced

- Understanding how to create a responsive design was challenging. I had to experiment with media queries to make sure the layout worked on different screen sizes.
- Figuring out how to style the Pokémon cards and layout to make them visually appealing took some trial and error.
- Planning for the "Load More" button and interactive elements on the details page without using JavaScript yet was a bit tricky. I had to think ahead about how to set things up for later.
